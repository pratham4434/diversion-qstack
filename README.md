## Problem Statement
Students who are new at coding face errors which they do not completely understand, the next thing they do is copy the code from stack overflow or any other site which sometime works but not everytime :(

Even after getting the right working code, full clarification is never achieved because few doubts cannot be cleared just by reading some documented code, they need a one-to-one explanation from an experienced coder.

## What is QStack?
Our web application QStack will provide the students a chance to get a videocall and chat explanation from a tutor for every doubt they have. All that the student has to do is to click a picture of his/her doubt and upload it on our website along with his/her query. He/she will get a reply by our fellow tutor in just 90 seconds.
